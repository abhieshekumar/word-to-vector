# Word Embeddings using ml5js

* The project makes use of [word2vec()](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-Word2vec/) API provided by [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) to explore word embeddings.
* Word Embedding represents words as vector.
* Read about word embedding in this [article](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469) by Allison Parrish.

## Visit the project

* https://abhieshekumar.github.io/word-to-vector/
> A 30MB file is loaded for the project to start. It might take some time.

## The project allows to

* View the five nearest words for a given word.
* Add or Subtract the vector representation of only two words and list the resultant five nearest words.
* The acceptable inputs are -
  * A single word as _holiday_.
  * Two words joined by the plus operator as _fun+games_.
  * Two words joined by the minus operator as _day-work_.
  * If in any case the word is not found a random suggestion is listed.
